  ## Description
  This is a README file generator. Created and processed through Node.js in your computer's terminal. This application will take you through a series of questions, from the title of your file , description, licenses, to asking if you would like to add screenshots and more. Based upon your answers, this application will create a header in Markdown format for each question and any information that you passed along with it and copy it and create a README.md file. It will also create a table of contents that you can click on each link, it will take you to that specific category in the README file. Also, depending if you selected a license or not, it will generate the license badge and display it on top of the README file. This was all done by using Node.js, JavaScript, GitHub and NPM Inquirer package.

  ## Installation
  To use this application, you would need to install Node.js and download NPM inquirer package from the NPM website at https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer

  ## Usage
  To use this application, you will need to go to the "README-Generator" file in your GitBash terminal and type in "node index.js". This will bring you to a series of questions (Title, Description, Installation, Usage, collaborators, Licenses, Contribution, Testing, GitHub Username, Email Address, Site URL & Screenshots). After you answer these questions, this application will process this information and create a README.md file. Once it is created, you can push your files to your GitHub repository and from there you can add any screenshots or screen recordings as needed and it the README.md file from there.
